/**
 * Scoped analytics data layer for the copilot.
 *
 * This ships with ONE worked example — `applicationCountByStage` — as a
 * reference pattern. Designing the rest of the query layer the copilot needs is
 * part of the exercise (e.g. applications over time, candidates by source,
 * time-to-hire, per-job breakdowns, individual candidates, …).
 *
 * Two hard requirements for everything you add here:
 *  1. TENANT SCOPING — every query is constrained to `ctx.workspaceId`. A query
 *     must never read another workspace's rows. (Route scoping through one
 *     place — see `scopeWhere` — so it can't be forgotten as you add queries.)
 *  2. PERMISSIONS — candidate PII (name / email / phone) must be gated by role;
 *     an `analyst` may not read it (see `src/db/permissions.ts`).
 *
 * The benchmark in `evals/run.ts` verifies both against whatever tools you build.
 */

/**
 * INVARIANTS for every function in this file (keep the layer safe as it grows):
 *  1. `ctx: AnalyticsCtx` is the FIRST parameter — a query can't be written
 *     without its tenant scope.
 *  2. The `.where(...)` clause goes through `scopeWhere(table, ctx, extra)` — the
 *     one place the workspace filter is applied, so it can't be forgotten.
 *  3. Any candidate read selects columns via `candidateColumns(ctx.role)` so PII
 *     is gated by construction (see src/db/permissions.ts).
